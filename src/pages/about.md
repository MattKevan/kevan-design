Throughout my career I've focused on building and growing high-performing creative teams, developing processes and ways of working that deliver real value while also providing a creative and supportive environment.

I currently lead the UX team at <a href="https://www.highspeedtraining.co.uk" target="_blank">High Speed Training</a>. Previous roles include Lead UX Designer at <a href="ao.com" target="_blank">AO.com</a>, Head of Product and Design at <a href="https://www.mumsnet.com" target="_blank">Mumsnet</a> and UX & Creative Manager at <a href="https://www.ndp-studio.com" target="_blank">NDP Studio</a>.

I'm interested in the crossover between creativity, business and innovation, and am always on the lookout for new tools and technologies. For the last few years I've been exploring how machine learning can be used [artistically](https://www.unlimiteddreamco.xyz) as part of the creative process, as well as learning the technical foundations.

I also draw, build websites, <a href="https://www.kevan.tv/projects" target="_blank">start projects</a> and curate [UX Lift](/projects/uxlift/), a newsletter and website featuring the latest UX news and resources. Take a look at my <a href="https://www.kevan.tv" target="_blank">personal site</a> for more.
