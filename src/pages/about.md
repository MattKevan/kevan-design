Throughout my career I've focused on building and growing high-performing creative teams, developing processes and ways of working that deliver real value while also providing a creative and supportive environment.

I currently lead the UX team at <a href="https://www.highspeedtraining.co.uk" target="_blank">High Speed Training</a>. Previous roles include lead UX designer at <a href="ao.com" target="_blank">AO.com</a>, head of product and design at <a href="https://www.mumsnet.com" target="_blank">Mumsnet</a> and creative manager at <a href="https://www.ndp-studio.com" target="_blank">NDP Studio</a>.

I'm interested in the crossover between creativity, design and technology, and am always on the lookout for new tools and technologies. I [create art](https://www.unlimiteddreamco.xyz) with generative artificial intelligence, draw, build websites and curate [UX Lift](/projects/uxlift/), a newsletter and website featuring the latest UX news and resources.
