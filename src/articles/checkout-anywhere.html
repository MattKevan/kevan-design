  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>With long-standing, successful and complex digital products, deciding whether to prioritise fixing problems or building new features can be a challenge. Often the decision comes down to whether it's better to fix  what's there already or to risk starting again and building from scratch.</p>
  <p>This case study looks at this challenge for a major online retailer and how I developed solutions using a lean product and UX approach.</p>

    <h2>User problems</h2>
    <p>I used quantative analytics data to investigate how customers were using the basket and checkout, identifying areas where people were having problems and dropping out of the flow. From this, I conducted a series of qualitative user interviews to dig further into the issues. The feedback I received fell into three main groups:</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-wide">
    <div class="content-wide max-w-none">

      <div class="columns-1 lg:columns-3 gap-6">
        <div class="bg-pink-200 dark:bg-pink-800 box mb-6 lg:break-after-column">
          <h3>Work-arounds</h3>
          <p>While the checkout had a decent conversion rate, we could see from analytics data that there was a significant drop-out at basket page. Users would add a product to their basket, go back to the catalogue to look for more products, add them to their basket, and so on. </p>
          <p>Research found that these users were using the basket as a comparison tool or to save products for later as this functionality wasn't available in the product catalogue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-pink-200  dark:bg-pink-800 box mb-6 lg:break-after-column">
          <h3>Delivery surprises</h3>
          <p>We found there was a big customer drop-out between the checkout delivery and payment pages. Users would enter their delivery details and then either exit the checkout entirely or go back to the product catalogue and look for a different product. </p>
          <p>Research found that users were entering the checkout as that was the only place where they could see the delivery times and cost. If the cost was too high or the delivery was inconvenient, they'd either try a different product or abandon the purchase entirely.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-pink-200 dark:bg-pink-800 box mb-6">
          <h3>The 'Ryanair' effect</h3>
          <p>After adding a product to the basket, the user is asked to select add-on services, such as unwrapping, rubbish disposal, installation and recycling. </p>
          <p>Users felt that while these services were worthwhile as they, along with the delivery fee, could add significantly to the price – an unwelcome surprise as this was not made clear before reaching the basket. One participant compared it to Ryanair, adding extra charges in the checkout and not being up-front about the real, higher price.</p>
        </div>

          <h4>Not scalable</h4>

          <h4>Can't support new journeys</h4>

          <h4>Hard to optimise</h4>

        <div class="bg-pink-200 dark:bg-pink-800 box mb-6 ">
          <h4>No separation of concerns</h4>

        <div class="bg-pink-200 dark:bg-pink-800 box mb-6 lg:break-after-column">
          <h4>Maintenance-heavy</h4>
          <p>Developers spend a lot of time doing things they shouldn’t have to, e.g. updating copy and adding services.</p>

        <div class="bg-pink-200 dark:bg-pink-800 box mb-6">
          <h4>Slow pace</h4>

          <h4>Can't improve UX</h4>

  <h2>UX review</h2>
  <p>To get a full picture of the problems and opportunities and to ensure everyone's ideas and suggestions were gathered, I held a series of UX review workshops with the product and developer squads, stakeholders and related teams. I synthesised all the research and data we had, including user insights, analytics, support queries and financial performance and added it to an end-to-end visualisation of the checkout journey. </p>
  <p>Participants were invited to add 'how might we' statements to highlight problems or suggest new features.</p>

    <h2 class="!mt-0">Hypotheses mapping and prioritisation</h2>
    <p> Working as part of a product trio with the product owner and technical lead, we converted all the 'how might we' statements into hypotheses that could be investigated further and prioritised according to value.</p>
    <p>As we worked through the process, key themes emerged which became the foundations of an opportunity map, helping us understand what further discovery was needed and the rough order they needed to be done in.</p>

## LEAN approach

## Minimal useful product


## Solution

It was clear that something needed to change as the teams had reached a sort of stalemate. The platform was too complex and fragile to work on at any pace, but it wasn’t possible to properly get a handle on the technical issues as they were bigger than any one team. 

The business had been discussing for quite some time whether it was better to focus on salvaging the existing platform, or starting from scratch and building something new. These both had significant pros and cons\

Salvage
Pros:
* The existing platform works.
* Less risky to fix an existing platform than building something new

Cons:
* No guarantee the existing platform is fixable


## Outcomes

High staff turnover and competing priorities meant that we found it increasingly hard to get the resources and time we needed. Departures in the senior leadership team meant we also lost high-profile sponsors of the project. After some poor post-Covid financial results, the chief executive decided to launch a new company-wide initiative. All existing work was put on hold or cancelled to make room for it, including this project.
