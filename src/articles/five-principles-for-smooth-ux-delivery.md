This post is a collection of things I've learned about delivering UX in a product team over the last few years. They aren't absolute truths and aren't right for all circumstances, but if you're a designer in a cross-functional product team you may find them useful.

As a TL:DR this whole piece can be condensed to: Communicate. With everyone. A lot.

### Rule 1: No designs

It's tempting as a designer to want to start designing as soon as possble. I've gone through the discovery process, I've got a good idea of a solution, so why not fire up Figma and get cracking?

But wait, not so fast. Designs too early in a project can be harmful for many reasons, including:

* **False expectations** – A nice design is a promise. If it turns out there isn't time or capacity to deliver it, you've broken that promise. 
* **Implied functionality** – Static drawings of interactive components are terrible for communicating how they should work. It's inevitable that you'll build-in assumptions or overlook things which will crawl out and cause havoc later.
* **Sunk cost fallacy** – A polished design fixes a solution in amber, making it harder to change or throw away. It might not be the right solution but you have no choice but to continue with it as there isn't the time or energy to start again with a better idea.
* **Maintenence hell** – Congratulations! If you've made a whole load of artboards, you're now responsible for making every single amend, no matter how minor, until the heat-death of the universe. Morale poison.

Instead, match the fidelity of your design to the fidelity of your solution.

At the beginning of a project, ideas should be light and easily disposable. Same for your designs

If you're still exploring ideas and are not sure of the right way to go, keep the designs ultra-lightweight: scribbles on the backs of envelopes

forget what it might look like and focus relentlessly on how it should work. Use post-it notes, Miro boards, scraps of envelope, whatever you have to hand, to explore the user journeys and features.

### 1. No surprises

This is the most important oneDo everything you can to remove surprises at every stage of the process. If anyone is surprised by anything at any point in the project, there's been a dreadful failure of communication.

If a developer is surprised by something they find in your designs, you've failed. By the time you've finished the design, you should have had so many conversations with them about it they could pretty much build it from memory.

If a stakeholder is surprised by something they've found when looking at a prototype, you've failed. Stakeholders should have been thoroughly involved during the planning and discovery phases and had enough communication to fully understand what's happening.

If a customer is surprised by a change to their favourite feature, you've failed. Customers should have been involved throughout the process and been made aware early and often that a change was coming.

This can only be solved by good, thorough, regular communication. People don't pay attention to most of what's said to them, so you need to keep repeating the message over and over again.

Everyone involved in a project needs to have a good understanding of the project and what it's trying to do. This is hard to achieve. Ideally however, everyone needs to have the *same* understanding, and that understanding needs to match the *actual* goals of the project. This is almost impossible, and has led to many successful careers in writing books and leading workshops.

Never assume that everyone understands the same thing - when you talk about a

The whole team - designers, developers, product managers, stakeholders and the wider organisation should have an understanding of both the problem that’s being solved and the approach taken to solve it. This requires carefully considered communication with all parties. Not everyone needs the same level of detail or frequency of communication, but if someone is surprised by what is proposed or what has been released, a communication failure has occured somewhere. 

Consider creating a [stakeholder power/interest grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_analysis) and communications plan when starting projects to understand your stakeholders and decide how best and how often to communicate with them.

Never assume everyone understands the same thing. Every person involved will have a different understanding of your project's goals. This is especially true for people who are not deeply involved or if what they do only touches one aspect of your project, but can also apply to core team members and stakeholders. 

Restate the problem and the project's goals as often as you possibly can - at the start of every meeting, in every email and much more besides. Consider even creating a shared vocabulary with the team so that you can be more confident that when a term is used everyone understands roughly the same thing.

### 2. No deliverables

UX activity is often focused around creating deliverables – journey maps, personas, shiny UI designs etc. We put a lot of effort into making them look nice. And then they're never looked at again.

Butvnn. Your job is to lead the team through the UX pr

your job is to lead the team through the UX process – discovering the problem, empathising with the user, creating and testing solutions etc. 
You're not there to create nice-looking documents that never get looked at again.



 For example personas and empathy maps are useful because the process of creating them helps build a shared understanding of your users between your team and stakeholders. The final format doesn't matter as long as it serves as a reminder to the discussions you had. This could be a photo of a whiteboard, a Miro or Figjam board, or even a big sheet of paper covered in post-its.

The same goes for most UX deliverables. They are tools for communication, not ends in themselves. Don't just 

### 3. No handovers

Passing designs to developers often feels like throwing them over the wall, hoping they're caught '

We don’t work in isolation, handing over our work at the last minute. Instead, we collaborate early and closely with developers as a single team to understand the problem, scope possible approaches and work to a shared solution.

### 4. No signoffs

While we may need approval for legal or compliance issues, we don’t need signoff before going live. Stakeholders should be well aware of the project and have had ample opportunity to contribute earlier in the process. And we should be confident in the quality and fitness-for-purpose of what we have created.

### 5. No last-minute changes

Last-minute changes mean that something has gone wrong in the project somewhere. It could be a communications failure in that someone wasn’t fully aware of the implications of a decision, or maybe the problem statement wasn’t properly explored at the beginning. It’s better to go back to the start and rethink things than release a broken or compromised product.
